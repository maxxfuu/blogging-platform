Database Connection File 
- Database Connection File is a file to maange the connection between your backend to the database.
_ However, to connect to a database you must first create the database. 

    Instructions 
    First go to the terminal and log into PostgreSQL using the psql CLI tool
    ```psql -U postgres``` 

    then create the database 
    ```CREATE DATABASE <name of database>```

    Then switch to the correct database that you are working on. 
    ```\c database_name``` 

    After switching into the database, run the file database.sql to create the table 
    ```psql -U postgres -d blogging_platform -f database.sql```  

        -U postgres: Specifies the username (replace with your PostgreSQL username).
        -d blogging_platform: Specifies the database to apply the script to.
        -f database.sql: Specifies the SQL file to execute.

    If successful, you'll see confirmation that the articles table has been created.
    Log in to the database again if you're not already connected:
    ```psql -U postgres -d blogging_platform ```  

   Check if the articles table exists 
    \dt 

    Inspect the table structure 
    \d articles
